=== ! no negative permissions
"The NIST (nist rbac) model is based on positive permissions that confer the ability to do something on holders of the permission. The NIST model does not rule out the use of so-called negative permissions which deny access. Thus vendors are free to add this feature. Nevertheless vendors and users are cautioned that use of negative permissions can be very confusing, especially in presence of general hierarchies. The uses to which they are put can often be better achieved by judicious use of constraints."

== ! Business rules and workflows
Does not ahe anything in common with security.

TODO: elaborate. Restricted documents in army Classified, Secret, Top Secret (ranks in the army vs positions held in the army).

TODO: elaborate: Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC). Con owner of  resource grant permission to another user to that permission?

=== drawbacks of rbac

=== The two questions:
. What User X can access?
. Who can access Resource Y?

While RBAC can answer to the first rule (and not the second), because the permissions are kept on the User (trough Roles)
int the form of a protected resource plus an allowed action, this framework unfortunately cannot respond neither.

=== Language

.Names used:
. users
. permissions
.. protected resource
.. actions
. subject
. session
.. security context

ABAC defines `Subject Attributes`, `Object Attributes` and `Environmental Attributes`

[IMPORTANT]
.Vulnerability aspects
====
I can identify two:

. a `PolicyRulesProvider` implementation can be build unsafely by being tricked to load malicious `PolicyRule` classes.
For example, a `PolicyRulesProvider` can load all `PolicyRule` subclasses from classpath. But into an open source
library used by the application, someone can add a `PolicyRule` that permit everything to a specific username for example.
. a `PolicyRule` can have bugs and unintendedly respond with PERMIT. So `PolicyRule` implementations must be fully tested
with all edge cases.
